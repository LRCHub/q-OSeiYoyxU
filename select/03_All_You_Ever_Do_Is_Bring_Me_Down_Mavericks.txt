I can't sleep a wink anymore
Ever since you first walked out the door
Then I just started drinking to forget
But I don't think the worst has happend yet
All you ever do is bring me down
Making me a fool all over town
They all wonder why I wear a frown
That's 'cause honey all you ever do is bring me down
Hear me now, I go, whoo
It's funny how my whole world fell apart
I think I saw it coming from the start
I tried to tell myself that you'd be true
But I expected way too much of you
All you ever do is bring me down
Making me a fool all over town
They all wonder why I wear a frown
That's 'cause honey all you ever do is bring me down
I take ma'm
All you ever do is bring me down
Making me a fool all over town
They all wonder why I wear a frown
That's 'cause honey all you ever do is bring me down
That's 'cause honey all you ever do is bring me down
Honey all you ever do is bring me down
Two, three, four
